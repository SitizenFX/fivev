Minecraft Forge – Standalone Fork by SitizenFX
===============================================

This standalone fork of Minecraft Forge is maintained by SitizenFX / Elijah Siita (VidllQ Authority). 
Forge is a set of tools and modifications to the Minecraft base game code to assist mod developers 
in creating new and exciting content. It has been in development for several years, but we would 
like to take this time to thank a few people and projects who have made this possible.

First, the people who originally created the Forge projects way back in Minecraft alpha: 
Eloraam of RedPower and SpaceToad of Buildcraft. Without their acceptance of LexManos taking over 
the project, who knows what Minecraft modding would be today.

Secondly, cpw, who developed Forge Mod Loader (FML) and some of the core features that allow 
modding to be as functional and simple as it is today. This includes stabilizing the client and 
server modding ecosystem as well as the base loading system that allows us to modify Minecraft's 
code efficiently.

Mezz, who has stepped up as the issue and pull request manager, keeping the project organized 
and helping guide the community into creating better additions to Forge.

Searge, Bspks, Fesh0r, ProfMobius, and the rest of the MCP team, for creating some of the core 
tools needed to make Minecraft modding possible and as stable as it can be. 

On that note, here is some specific information about the MCP data we use:

    * Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP) *
      Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge have permission to distribute and automatically 
      download components of MCP and MCP data files. This permission is not transitive; anyone 
      wishing to redistribute the source independently should seek permission from MCP or remove 
      MCP data and request their users download MCP separately.

And lastly, the countless community members who have spent time submitting bug reports, 
pull requests, and helping the community in general. Thank you.

This is Forge Mod Loader (FML) – Standalone Fork.

You can find the original source code at:
https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/tree/1.12.x/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/fml

This fork is a clean, open-source implementation of a mod loader for Minecraft servers and clients. 
The code is authored by cpw and includes contributions from the community.

It began by partially implementing an API defined by the client-side ModLoader, authored by Risugami:
https://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/75440- 
This support was dropped as of Minecraft release 1.7, as Risugami no longer maintains ModLoader.

It also contains suggestions and generous code contributions from LexManos, author of MinecraftForge:
https://minecraftforge.net/

Additionally, this fork includes:

- An implementation of topological sort inspired by:
  http://keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/?dir=topological-sort

- Code from the Apache Maven project for performing versioned dependency resolution:
  http://maven.apache.org/

- A partial repackaging of the javaxdelta library from:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaxdelta/
  Credits to its original authors.

- Monocraft font for early loading display:
  https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/

Forge Mod Loader downloads components from the Minecraft Coder Pack:

with kind permission from the MCP team.
